# Card Memory Game 

The card memory game is a project which can help to improve our memory. It is inspired by Harry Potter story. The grid of cards include characters from Harry Potter book. The goal is to find all the pairs in as few moves as possible. If a match is found, the cards stay flipped, if not, they will turn back. The game continues until all cards are flipped.
